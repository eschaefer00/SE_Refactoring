# SE_Refactoring

This repository has the purpose of exercising recatoring with Fowler's raw code. 

These are IntteliJ's useful functions for refactoring that I have dicovered during the exercise: 

- refactoring functions such as code cleanup and optimising imports
- provided shortcuts for easy usage 
- highlighted tips within the editor (warnings, errors)
- smartly coloured code (grey = not used, ...) 
- warning before commit and push -> IDE asks if you are sure to commit and push changes if there are warnings or errors within the code
